# StackStorm Implementation

This project implements a comprehensive monitoring and management system using StackStorm and Discord for real-time notifications and actions. The system is designed to enhance resource management, process monitoring, and automated recovery in a server environment.

## Features

1. **Zombie Process Detection and Management**: Automatically identifies and manages zombie processes with validation through Discord notifications.
2. **Real-Time Notifications**: Sends critical alerts for high CPU usage, disk space issues, and other important events directly to Discord.
3. **Detailed Logging**: Logs all actions taken by the system, including process management and resource monitoring.
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitors CPU, RAM, disk usage, and network activity, providing alerts based on customizable thresholds.
5. **Temporary File Management**: Manages temporary files with notifications for deletion and confirmation through Discord.
6. **Automated Reporting**: Generates daily and monthly reports on resource usage and optimization actions.
7. **Dynamic Process Priority Management**: Adjusts process priorities based on resource usage and administrator commands.
8. **Network Management**: Monitors network bandwidth and detects high usage processes, sending alerts as necessary.
9. **Automatic Recovery**: Restarts failed services or containers automatically and notifies administrators.
10. **Integration with External Monitoring**: Integrates with external monitoring systems and sends notifications to Discord.
11. **Advanced Cache Cleaning**: Provides commands for cleaning specific caches and logs the results.
12. **CPU Limitation**: Allows administrators to set CPU limits for specific processes.
13. **Process Time Monitoring**: Monitors processes that exceed normal execution time and notifies administrators.
14. **Multithreading Optimization**: Analyzes thread usage and provides optimization recommendations.
15. **Customizable Thresholds**: Administrators can set new resource usage thresholds via Discord commands.
16. **Power Saving Mode**: Activates or deactivates power-saving mode based on system status.
17. **Malware Detection**: Scans for suspicious processes and notifies administrators of detected threats.
18. **Docker Restart Automation**: Automatically restarts Docker containers that fail and notifies administrators.
19. **Anomaly Detection**: Detects abnormal activities in the system and alerts administrators.
20. **Self-Healing System**: Automatically fixes simple issues and reports the results.
21. **Energy Efficiency Metrics**: Monitors energy efficiency and recommends power-saving measures.

## Installation
